       <p class="bio">Sebastian Vettel (born 3 July 1987) is a German racing driver 
          currently driving in Formula One for Scuderia Ferrari. He is a four-time 
          Formula One World Champion, 
          having won the championship in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 
          with Red Bull Racing, therefore being among the most successful 
          F1 drivers of all time, as he is one of only four drivers 
          to have won four or more drivers' titles.<br> He is regarded by fellow and 
          former drivers as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the history 
          of the sport. Vettel signed a three-year contract with Ferrari 
          upon his arrival, a contract later extended until the end of 2020.
          Vettel started his career in Formula One as a test driver for BMW Sauber 
          and made his debut with the team at the 2007 United States Grand Prix, 
          replacing the injured Robert Kubica. <br>Later in the season, he signed with 
          Toro Rosso and stayed with the team into 2008. He became the youngest race 
          winner at the time when he took victory at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. 
          In his first year driving for Red Bull in 2009, Vettel finished the season 
          as the youngest-ever World Drivers' Championship runner-up. The following 
          year he went on to become the youngest driver ever to win the World 
          Drivers' Championship, aged 23. In the same year he helped Red Bull 
          win the team's first World Constructors' Championship. <br><br>He followed up 
          his first championship with three more titles, becoming the <strong><u>youngest 
          double, triple and quadruple world champion</u></strong> in Formula One. <br>The 
          2010 and 2012 titles were decided in the final round, in 2010 coming out 
          on top over Fernando Alonso and Ferrari in a four-way title battle at 
          Abu Dhabi, whilst in 2012 defeating Alonso and Ferrari again by three 
          points. The 2011 and 2013 titles saw Vettel dominating the seasons and 
          wrapping up the titles early.<br><br>
          Vettel left Red Bull Racing and ended his long-term association with 
          the company after the 2014 season and signed a contract with Ferrari 
          for 2015, after activating a clause to terminate his Red Bull contract 
          early. After his winless 2014 season he returned to winning ways in 
          his first Ferrari season, being the closest challenger to the dominant 
          Mercedes cars and winning three races. <br>After a winless 2016 season in 
          fourth place of the championship, Vettel and Ferrari enjoyed a 
          resurgence in 2017, topping the table at half distance of the 
          championship with several wins.<br><br>
          Vettel has held numerous other "youngest" Formula One records, 
          among them: the youngest driver to have taken part in an official 
          practice session of a Grand Prix (until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> at the 2014 
          Japanese Grand Prix), to score championship points (until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat">Daniil 
          Kvyat</a> at the 2014 Australian Grand Prix), to lead a race 
          (until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix), 
          to win a race (until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix) 
          and to secure pole position. He is also currently in fourth place among all time 
          race winners.<br><br><a id="more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel">
